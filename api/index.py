In what situations do we disclose your Personal Information?\\n\\nWe may disclose your Personal Information to a third party, such as a service provider or contractor for a business or operational purpose, or with your consent.

How is my Personal Information protected?\\n\\nOur Retention, Purpose Limitation, and Security Policies\\n\\nWe protect your Personal Information through a combination of collection, security, and retention policies.\\n\\n    \\u2022 Limited retention: We retain each category of Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Information was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with any legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce contracts. For example, we may retain Personal Information collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Service if your account has been banned or your access to our Services has been disabled for any reason. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example, subject to the foregoing considerations, it is our policy to delete your Personal Information if we stop operating our Games or the feature through which the Personal Information was acquired.\\n\\n    \\u2022 Purpose limitation: We will use your Personal Information only for our Services you choose to access and for the purposes notified to you, unless we otherwise obtain your consent. We limit the collection of Personal Information to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for those purposes.  \\n\\n    \\u2022 Security measures: We use reasonable security measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the volume and nature of Personal Information processed and risk involved, considering the size, scope, and type of our business, and have implemented contractual, technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Notice does not guarantee the security of your Personal Information. In the event of a security breach, we will notify the proper regulatory authorities and any affected users of the breach within 72 hours after we become aware of the breach to the extent required by applicable law.\\n\\nYour Practices and Activities\\n\\nYour practices and activities are likewise very important for the protection of your Personal Information.

How do we treat Personal Information transferred to the United States?\\n\\nPlace of Business\\n\\nWe may store or process your Personal Information outside of the country where we collect the information or the country in which you reside. Our primary place of business is in the United States. You should understand that we may transfer some or all of your Personal Information to the United States to carry out certain operational and processing needs as described in this Notice.\\n\\nTransfer Mechanisms\\n\\nWhen transferring Personal Information out of foreign countries, we implement technical, organizational, and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Information.

We are not aware of any third party that tracks users of our Services over time and across third party websites or online services. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the Global Privacy Control, a legally recognized browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for certain purposes.\\n\\nCalifornia Shine the Light Law\\n\\nThe following applies to California residents:\\n\\n    \\u2022 California residents may request information from us concerning any disclosures of Personal Information we may have made in the prior calendar year to third parties for direct marketing purposes.

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers and contractors to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception under applicable law applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers or contractors to: \\n\\n        \\u25E6 complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, provide our Services that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you; \\n        \\u25E6 help to ensure the security and integrity of our Services to the extent the use of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate to those purposes; \\n        \\u25E6 debug our Services to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; \\n        \\u25E6 exercise free speech, ensure the right of another user to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law; \\n        \\u25E6 comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act; \\n        \\u25E6 engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the Personal Information\\u2019s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research\\u2019s achievement, if you previously provided consent; \\n        \\u25E6 enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with user expectations based on your relationship with us and compatible with the context in which you provided the Personal Information; or \\n        \\u25E6 comply with a legal obligation.\\n\\n    \\u2022 Right to Correction: You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information.

We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.\\n\\nResponse Timing and Format \\n\\nWe endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.
